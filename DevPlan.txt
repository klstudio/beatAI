* collision detection and simple behaviour tree
* simple map run to a point -> jump -> run to treasure box
* AI: avoid collision of dynamic star


- investigating AI technique and integration
- basic map and ai architecture
- loading ai and level scripts
- demo ninjia sprite following ai script




—————————————————————————————————
design decision:
using AABB separating axis algorithm for dynamic collision test
evaluate/estimate collision in future 5 frames
for static object, there’s no need for dynamic collision test as long as ninja speed is not too high than its own width/height
